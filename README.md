# Diabetic-Retinopathy
Contains program in Python that can classify images of human eye retina affected by Diabetic retinopathy from the normal images of human eye retina.
1. Used two different sets of Human eye retina images for training the model. One set is the normal human eye retina images and the other one is affected due to Diabetic Retinopathy.
2. Used two layer convolutional neural network and ReLu activation function.
3. Used Binary Crossentropy loss function and Adam optimizer.
4. Used test images to determine the predicted result.
